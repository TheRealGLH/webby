# Webbington

Originally based on the final project in the online book ['The Rust Programming Language'](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html), the last part of this exercise challenges readers to go beyond the exercise and enhance the project in various ways. As a result, this is hardly production ready but this is more so for me to have fun and learn a different language.


## How to use

### Requirements
- Cargo 1.83.0 or later

### Compilation & Running

```sh
cargo build
```
```sh
webbington [-p <port>] [-d <base_dir>]
```

If the port or directory are not specified, the default port will be 7676 and the directory will be $PWD.
