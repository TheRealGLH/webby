Originally based on the final project in the online book ['The Rust Programming Language'](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html), the last part of this exercise challenges readers to go beyond the exercise and enhance the project in various ways. As a result, this is hardly production ready but this is more so for me to have fun and learn a different language.
